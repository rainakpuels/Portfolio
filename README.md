# Portfolio

# About:

 [Click here to see my Developer Portfolio.](https://rainakpuels.github.io/Portfolio)

I built this website to showcase the projects I make during the MIT xPro Full Stack Professional Certificate in Coding.

I started with the "Ablum" Bootstrap template, and customized it for my needs. The project is mostly HTML and CSS.

# Roadmap of Future Improvemenets

As I become a more experienced developer, I hope to integrate more JavaScript and other complex elements.
